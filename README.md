_Start by setting your git machine_ [install it](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)

## Steps to Collaborate

### Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top right corner of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

### Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

```
https://github.com/your-name
```

where `your-name` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the [HacktoberFest-2020](https://github.com/) repository on GitHub to your computer.

Before cloning the repository you just make sure that you have changed the directory to _Desktop_ or to some other locations, To change the directory to Desktop run the following command:

```
cd Desktop
```

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd HacktoberFest-2020
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b <your-new-branch-name>
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b add-john-doe
```

(The name of the branch does not need to have the word _add_ in it, but it's a reasonable thing to include because the purpose of this branch is to add your name to a list.)
